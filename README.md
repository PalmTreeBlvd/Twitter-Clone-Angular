# Twitter Clone

This is Twitter clone built in Angular that I worked on over the summer before starting at Code Differently. I used FontAwesome and Angular Material for the icons, RxJS and CSS variables for the dark theme / light theme toggle, and then added hover transitions, sticky scrollable sidebars, styled input fields and made the site completely responsive.

My goal was to create a near pixel perfect clone without taking shortcuts to really understand CSS and to learn TypeScript. I found myself really enjoying both, especially TypeScript, because of its similarity to strongly-typed programming languages such as Java and C# which I also love using. There are still a few more things I want to add but I'm really excited about how it's coming out!

## To Run
